# StrideBeats
Project for ECSE 542: Human-Computer Interaction

## Setup instructions:

Once you've cloned the repo, use a bash shell to navigate to the directory of the repo and run the following commands:

`npm install --global expo-cli`

`yarn`

`expo start`

This will launch the Expo Developer Tools in a new browser tab.

To test on iPhone, download the Expo Go app and scan the QR code in the Expo Developer Tools to launch the app.

To test on browser, simply press the "Run in web browser" button from the Expo Developer Tools.
