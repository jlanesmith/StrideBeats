# StrideBeats
Project for ECSE 542: Human-Computer Interaction

## Testing instructions

To run the app, download the Expo Go app on your mobile device. Launch the app and press the bottom right tab to take you to the profile page. Next, sign in with the following credentials:

Username: `jlanesmith`
  
Password: `hciinteraction`
  
From here, press “StrideBeats” under Recent Projects, and then press “default”. This will launch the app on your phone and you are good to go! 


## Development instructions:

Launch a bash shell and navigate to a directory where you would like to clone the repo and run the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/jlanesmith/StrideBeats.git`

`cd StrideBeats`

`npm install --global expo-cli`

`yarn`

`expo start`

This will launch the Expo Developer Tools in a new browser tab.

To run on iPhone or Android, download the Expo Go app and scan the QR code in the Expo Developer Tools to launch the app.

If you do not have a mobile device, you may run the app in browser. To do this, simply press the "Run in web browser" button from the Expo Developer Tools. Note that running the app in the web browser means that haptic feedback will not be given, so the user experience will be better if it is run with a mobile device.
